        <h2>Cheekies Birthday Messageüê£</h2>
        <p>
            It's another year, and you are about to enter a new age, usually with each birthday message; it's usually a bunch of jokes and a lot of funny promises, ouu we can't forget the prayers, too. This year, I want to switch it up a bit. From sticking with you as the best friend God designed me to be, I have seen you grow in many areas, mainly with respect to your spiritual journey and personal development. I have come to see you become the prayer warrior and interceder God designed you to be. I have seen you exhibit a character consistent with the word of God, and I see each day how God prunes and moulds your heart to a heart that is pleasing before him. You have grown so much from the time I have known you until now. I see the counsel of wisdom in everything you do, even if you don't see it, and I know at times it feels like you are not growing, but I know my best friend, and I know my Pookie; I have seen who you were before and who you are now and trust me they are two different people. I just want to say that in this new age, God is going to do something new in your life, and men will witness the manifestation of his power in your life and know that, truly, you serve a living God. My prayer for you in this new age is that you may receive grace to study your bible more; I pray that you may open the scriptures and receive the water that lies in each dimension of the verses. I also pray that in your new age, your testimony will be that of Esther. Wherever you go to you will find favour in the eyes of men. Finally, I pray that all your heart desires aligned with his will come to pass in Jesus' matchless name I pray. I am extremely blessed to have you in my life, and I hope you have the best time on this day.
